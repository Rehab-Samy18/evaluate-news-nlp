                           Here's my News Article Using NLP Project :)


-I've folowed the steps mentioned in developement strategy in the classroom .. 

-To begin in the project, I'v followed the 4 lessons in the classroom that helped me to 
1)Set up webpack.
2)learn sass styles
3)install webpack loaders and plugins .
4)Service workers
5)Use APIs and create requests. 

-I've made an account on the meaning cloud and received my API_KEY and I've declared it in .env file:
API_KEY=**************************

-I've added a GET route that returns the projectData object in the server code Then, added a POST route that adds incoming data to projectData.

-I've used the base url and API key i've received from meaning cloud to connect to it.

-I've chained another Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to my app.

-The last step I did is changing some style in the css files :)
